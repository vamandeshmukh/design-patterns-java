/**
 * 
 * Facade pattern hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface
 * to the client using which the client can access the system. This type of
 * design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern adds an
 * interface to exiting system to hide its complexities. This pattern involves a
 * single class which provides simplified methods which are required by client
 * and delegates calls to existing system classes methods.
 * 
 * Implementation - We're going to create a Shape interface and concrete classes
 * implementing the Shape interface. A facade class ShapeMaker is defined as a
 * next step. ShapeMaker class uses the concrete classes to delegates user calls
 * to these classes.FacadePatternDemo, our demo class will use ShapeMaker class
 * to show the results.
